			<h2>Lore bit no.1</h2>
			<p>Has an affinity with eating ram sticks. Although, more specifically, she oftens eats 6 GB ram sticks. As they’re not as ‘crunchy’ as 8 GB ram sticks, but not as ‘bland’ as 4 GB ram sticks.</p>
			<h2>Lore bit no.2</h2>
			<p>Sweats a bit every time she sees something shiny, due to how much she has to render at once.</p>
			<h2>Lore Bit no.3</h2>
			<p>Xbox-chan is her enemy >:(</p>
			<h2>Lore Bit no.4</h2>
			<p>She only has her katana and gun for emergency purposes, in-case her owner gets injured.</p>
			<h2>Lore Bit no.5</h2>
			<p>She has some gauze on her knees because she finds it aesthetically pleasing. Not necessarily due to having an abnormal relationship with recovery, but just because she sees a pattern of people having little things like bandages, gauze, or the like.</p>
			<h2>Lore Bit no.6</h2>
			<p>Whenever she needs to, she can instantly change her outfit into any of the following shown <a href="#outfit" style="color: white;">here.</a></p>
			<h2>Lore Bit no.7</h2>
			<p>If an error occurs, she would automatically say it out loud in a more robotic voice, whilst also suggesting a couple of solutions to said problem.</p>
